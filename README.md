# Description
A small dictionary trainer program. Functionalities include:
* Vocab practice mode: word is shown, user prompted to enter translation, feedback given. If answer was correct, word is dropped from the practice round, otherwise it will be shown again.
* Vocab test mode: same as above, but if the user entered the wrong translation, (s)he gets no 2nd chance to get it right. At the end, a test result is shown
* Viewing, adding and deleting vocab. Changes to the vocab (as well as previous fails) are recorded and written to file prior to the user exiting the program
* User input validation provided to avoid breakdowns
